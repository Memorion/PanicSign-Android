This is a pretty simple Android port of the iOS-Application described in [this](https://panic.com/blog/the-panic-sign/) blogpost.

I added two additional features:
 - Shake the phone for random colors
 - Voice control
(The latter works by "abusing" the ability to search in apps through the Google Assistant/Google Now.

On devices with the Google play services and Google Now/Assistant enabled this should work:  
"Ok Google, search for `color1` and `color2` in/on Panic Sign".
